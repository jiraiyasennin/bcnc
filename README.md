Test required for the recruiting process

The test has been developed using Django Rest Framework and the plugin for swagger https://drf-yasg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/readme.html#installation, for filters https://github.com/philipn/django-rest-framework-filters
The urls are:
for Swagger
http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/

For Redoc
http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

Due to the lack of time to implement the code in a server, I just share this repository.
Thanks.
